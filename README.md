# Text-Input-Module
A module for fast, goodlooking, functional and fully custom text inputs.
Built with PHP as an html templating engine. JS handlers manage input validation, display of validation status on field labels and inputs and dynamic input lines.

Included in the demo but not officially part of the framework, js manager for keyboard form navigation and keybinding as well as custom validation tieing dynamically generated field pairs together.

Tips : <br/>
`Enter` and `Tab` go Forward <br/>
`Shift + Enter` and `Shift + Tab` go Back <br/>
`Backspace` goes back if there is no content in the input <br/>
